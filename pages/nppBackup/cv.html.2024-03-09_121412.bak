	<p>A professional with a T-shaped skill set ranging across OSINT, research, information security, and data analytics and a drilled down expertise in writing and reporting.</p>
	<p>Although, most days I'm a little bit of everything. From web development, to cybersecurity, to OSINT, all of these skills were founded in my curiosity 
	and the drive to inform. I have two goals: inform those in power about security issues and give context about why they need to care about them, 
	and to educate children and their guardians about online privacy and security.</p>

	<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
	<p>2020-2022</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Through a guided project written by Marynia Kolak, Moksha Menghaney, Qinyun Lin, and Angela Li, I learned how to perform geospatial analysis techniques such as: geocoding, buffer analysis, and nearest resource analysis. <a href = "https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/MethadoneClinicsGeospatialAnalysis" target ="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.</li>
	  <li>Using data analysis tools such as R programming, Tableau, and Excel, analyzed 20+ Facebook ad campaigns to identify essential metrics to measure and track for high return on investment, resulting in a 2% decrease in marketing costs and time spent. | September 2022 - October 2022</li>
	  <li>In part of completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, I created a custom capstone project that analyzed Greenhouse Gas Emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Find the full report here: <a href="https://rpubs.com/joycuratoR/RadiantEnergy" target="_blank">RPubs</a></li>
      <li>The game Elden Ring exploded in popularity in 2022 and many Reddit users had negative and positive thoughts about its game mechanics. So using Reddit's API, I parsed and cleaned qualitative data to conduct sentiment analysis to discover the impact of Elden Ring's boss mechanics.
