      <p>This <a href="https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-001/" target="_blank">OSINT challenge</a> was created by Sofia Santos of Gralhix. I do not take credit for creating this challenge, this is simply for the purpose of documenting my thoughts as I'm solving this challenge.</p>

<h4>Task briefing:</h4>

<p>Below you can see a screenshot from a tweet containing a photo. It contains all the relevant information necessary to help you find the exact location.  
Please identify the coordinates of where the photo was taken.</p>

<h2>Step by Step Account</h2>

<p>31st December, 2023</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immediately, my first thought was to do a reverse search on the image</li>
  <li>But seeing that there was a city name mentioned in the text of the tweet, I thought that could equally be another good starting point</li>
  <li>I also note before beginning my search that the tweet had been translated from Arabic, so that tells me that the photo could have some Arabic origins but that would just be an assumption</li>
  <li>I use TinEye to do a reverse search of the image URL and find that there is a handful of links pointing to different Medium blogs. </li>
  <li>I then search on Google for the city of Kiffa and look at some images, and the images I see do match the aesthetic of the photo I've been given to work with. I then come across this promising photo from a site called Advisor Travel and the caption says "Interesting photos of Kiffa (Muritaaniya) tourist attractions". It shows a tan building with some green trimmings and arches.</li>
  <li>The green trimmings kind of appear in the challenge photo on the far left building but the fact it's shadowed by something make it hard to confirm. Nonetheless, it's a some sort of lead to pursue.</li>
  <li>My next thoughts are: I can research some tourist attractions in the city of Kiffa, what Muritaaniya is, and look at the colors in the challenge photo via a color histogram and RGB channels.</li>
  <li>A Google search corrects my spelling to Mauritania which is a country in Africa which is good to know but zooms me out when I want to zoom in. I then, pause to think about what else a photo can reveal and immediately facepalm when I remember the existence of EXIF data. So I download the challenge photo put it through an online EXIF tool and......... nothing.</li> 
  <li>Now, I'm scratching my head, thinking that maybe Twitter strips EXIF data for privacy reasons? A quick Google search confirms that thought. </li>
  <li>Dang. &#x1F643;</li>
  <li>Maybe I have to find the original tweet, if it's still there? &#x1F914;</li>
  <li>I take a longer break, do something else, and come back to it. I'm not above getting help from the video that's accompanied by the challenge but I want to hold off on using it for a little bit longer.</li>
  <li>Coming back to it, I focused in on the idea of the left most building being part of a mosque or grand building of some sort. I went to Google Maps and typed in city of Kiffa and searched through the images to see if I can get closer yet definite location where I can narrow my search for this needle. I ignore all photos that don't show a paved road since one of the landmarks to help me is a paved road in the challenge photo.</li>
  <li>I try using the Terrain Layer option in Google Maps to look but it's not yielding any results. At this point, I'm going have to concede and use a hint.</li>
  <li>Okay, so I stopped the video around 3:53 when Sofia mentioned that she had left the date of the tweet on purpose since things change and it's important to know when things were taken. I wonder if I am supposed to try to find an archive of this tweet or if she just mentions this detail because it's good for OSINT practitioners to document things properly.</li>
  <li>I paused again at 6:25 after I was shown that you can get a street view of some places in Kiffa, so I'm going to play around with this and see if I can get any where new in my investigation.</li>
  <li>I did find a mosque that had very similar architecture as the one in the challenge photo when I looked through the additional photos of the place. </li>

  <li>But there wasn't anything else that can confirm they are one in the same.</li>  
  <li>At this point, I've spent much too long looking on Google Maps and getting nowhere, so I wave my white flag and go back to the video to find the answer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I didn't think to use the big tree behind the building strip on the right side in the challenge photo as a landmark to search for. I did take note of the buildings, and the paved road with the large gaps of dirt but I also didn't quite make note of the dip in the paved road nor the electrical poles.</li>
  <img src="../Images/osint-exercise-001-big-picture-markedup.jpeg" class="article-image">
  <li>A seemingly bare-bones photo is deceptively simple to locate, once you know what landmarks are solid points of references to help narrow down what to look for.</li>
  <li>A new tool in the tool belt: Google Earth Pro with the ability to go back in time and see how things looked like then. Which is why the date of the twitter post was kept in the challenge photo.</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Though I feel wet behind the ears in the world of OSINT, I'm pretty proud of myself for trying, despite not succeeding in solving the challenge.</p>

<p>The main takeaway is that I now know a method of searching for the location of obscure photos with no metadata to tap into.</p>

<p>The biggest takeaway is that learning OSINT is very similar to learning a programming language. Which means to not be afraid to look up how to do something when you get stuck and that knowledge and experience of the skill builds slowly - block by block.</p>

<p>Thank you to Sofia Santos for creating this challenge. I will definitely come back to try the other ones.</p>

<p>Upwards and onwards! &#x1F600;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>
