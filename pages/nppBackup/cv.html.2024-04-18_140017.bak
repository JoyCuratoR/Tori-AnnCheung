	<p>A professional with a T-shaped skill set spanning open-source intelligence, research, and information security, complemented by expertise in geolocation analysis and technical writing/reporting.</p>
	<p>Although, most days I'm a little bit of everything. From web development, to information security, to OSINT, all of these skills were founded in my curiosity 
	and the drive to inform. I have a long-term goal of creating an educational organization that teaches risk evaluation skills for internet activities to groups particularly vulnerable online.</p>
