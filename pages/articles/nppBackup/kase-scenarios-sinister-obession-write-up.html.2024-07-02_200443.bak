    <h2>Process & Analysis</h2>
	<p><b>Brief overview of the CTF:</b> Liam Kim is a veteran detective yet new to using OSINT methods. "Liam has been working on a stalker case where the famous singer-songwriter Sophia Blake has been experiencing Cyber harassment. After a recent escalation by the stalker Liam and his team put all their efforts into uncovering the identity of the unknown stalker and bring them in for charges."</p>
    <p><b>Objectives:</b> Identify Sophia Blake's stalker.</p>

		The backstory and objective
	</figcaption>
    <p><b>Description of the starting point:</b> The initial question was "What site does this profile account belong to?"</p>
    <p>The National Crime Agency obtained a profile account that is connected to Sophia Blake's stalker case. This makes the profile account a starting lead to establishing who our person of interest is. Ms. Blake has informed our team that her stalker signs all his messages as "From I". Given how this account's name is "shadowark_ian" strongly correlates with the notion that this account is connected to this case.</p>
    <p><b>Initial thoughts and approach:</b> The website design and layout has a distinctive style, so I saved it to a folder and uploaded it into Google Images. The results informed me that the layout likely matched Keybase.io. The results showcasing website links to "shadoark_ian (Ian C) - Keybase" also clued me in that this was the right website.</p>

        <h3>4. What is the name associated with the public PGP key?</h3>
        <p>Research process: Not understanding how a PGP works, only that it is part of OpenPGP. I Googled how to decrypt a public PGP key that's on Keybase. From this I learned that GPG is a tool that could decrypt a public PGP key and I used a virtual machine to do so.</p>

        <h3>5. Find more of Ian's online accounts.</h3>
        <p>Research process: Going back to the two Keybase accounts that have already been confirmed to be connected to Ian Carlsk, I noticed a slashed out log that most likely indicated the information had been deleted.</p>

        <h3>7. Using the GitHub profile name, discover the associated email address.</h3>
        <p>Research process: A quick Google search of the name "shadow-arkwave" yield little useful results. The same result occured with an added dorking term "shadow-arkwave site: github.com". This led me to believe that the profile shadow-arkwave has been deleted, which could be recovered using the Wayback Machine. Using the URL format when viewing a GitHub profile I searched for "http://github.com/shadow-arkwave" but that yield zero results. To be thorough, inside of the Wayback Machine I also searched for "http://github.com/ianc_shadows" and "http://github.com/shadowark_ian" yet both yield zero results. After some time experiencing, I discovered that while a normal Google search of shadow-arkwave wouldn't yield any results, simply typing in github.com/shadow-arkwave in my browser's search bar led me directly to the account. So I concluded that there are other ways of obtaining a GitHub email that I am unaware of and thus, searched and found a tutorial that helped me.</p>

        <h3>9. What city is the person of interest located at?</h3>
        <p>Research process: I didn't understand how svg files and png/jpeg files different in how they stored data so I didn't have a good idea of how to reveal the blacked out information. However, I discovered that svg files can be opened with Notepadd++ because of how the metadata is structured. Then I found the code that illustrated the blacked out boxes, deleted it from the file, saved the file, and then reopened the svg file. After, the blacked out information was revealed.</p>

        <h3>10. Make a timeline of when the person of interest listed the NES for sale and posted about it on Tumblr. What is the date of the Tumblr post?</h3>
        <p>Research process: Initially, I searched on Wayback Machine since it was an immediate thought to do so. However, that lead didn't produce any solid results. Looking back on the prompt, it asked me to look at "Tumblr archive" which I thought was oddly put until I realized that Tumblr had it's own archive feature. Then, I looked up how to access an account's archive and from there I was able to find a photo of the NES listing.</p>

        <h3>11. Who is the relationship between the person of interest and the Tumblr account who commented on the NES post?</h3>
        <p>Research process: Noted earlier in my research, Ian Carlsk's Tumblr post of the listing of the NES gaming device, there was a comment made by the account named "ccartistry" that seemed like they had a close relationship with Ian Carlsk. Clicking on the account "ccartistry" brought my attention to post with two images that showed a text messaging conversation and a partial view of a car's navigation system. It was through this discovery that we know Ian Carlsk has a sister.</p>

        <h3>12. What is the make and model that has this car interior?</h3>
        <p>Research process: I initially searched for online tools that would help me identify cars by all I could find were tools that identified cars by their exterior. Examining the two photos captured earlier from the ccartistry's Tumblr post and using editing tools to enhance them, I spotted a partial logo on the steering wheel. Using reverse search image, Google Images informed me that the make and model matched Hyundai Kona. I examined a couple other results to try and corroborate this lead, though none of my results lead to a direct match.</p>

        <h3>13. From the navigation pictured in one of the photos captured from ccartistry's Tumblr post, what city is the car located?</h3>
        <p>Research process: I began at the most obvious place and Googled "Altstadt" which I discovered is German for 'old town'. One of the Google results provided a few instances of Düsseldorf so that is where I searched first. Unironically, it lead me almost directly on top of where the dot in the navigation system is positioned.</p>

	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>Beyond the typical frustration one feels when they hit a wall that seems impossible to get over or around - that lesson being patience - the most useful lesson was understanding that the way you treat practice matters. It matters down to the small things because they are what make up the big things. How you act in practice is how you'll act in real situations. The small actions you take daily build up to how you handle bigger challenges. Rarely do big things get handed to you fully pieced together; instead, they're assembled from these smaller actions.</p>
	<p>The best techniques for finding how to find things is undoubtedly Google (or any other search engine). If normal searching fails, then Google Dorking is the next step.</p>
