      <h1>Last time I attempted Sofia Santos' OSINT challenges, I was a bit gung-ho with choosing my first challenge that was designated as difficult for beginners. So to scale back a bit, let's see if I am successful with a challenge that is easy for beginners.</h1>

<p>In tandem with this posting this <a href="">[[Treating an OSINT Challenge as if it is a Real Case- Practicing the Intelligence Cycle]]</a>, I will document this following the intelligence cycle as well as providing my real-time thoughts.</p>

<p>[table of contents]</p>

      <li>Step by Step Thought Process</li>

</ul>

<h1>Background of Challenge</h1>

<p>On January 19, 2023, a journalist with almost 140k followers on Twitter shared an image of a destroyed vehicle amidst a large cloud of smoke and fire. The tweet said: “<em>BREAKING: TTP</em> <em>carried out a suicide attack on a police post in Khyber city of Pakistan that killed three Pakistani police officers.</em>“</p>   

<p>The photo is not of the event described by the journalist.  
a) Verify the statement above.</p>

<p><strong>Note: You do NOT need to find the author of the tweet seen below. Do NOT harass the journalist.</strong></p>

<p>~ from <a href="https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-006/">Challenge #006</a></p> 

<h1>Planning &amp; Direction</h1>  

<h2>Guiding  Question(s)</h2>

<p>While the task briefing gives me an objective to complete, I still need a guiding question to specify a direction. My initial question is what I consider the knee-jerk question that first comes to mind. I like to write this down because most, if not all, branching questions comes from this first one.</p>   

<p><strong>Initial Question</strong>: Is this tweet mis- or disinformation?</p>  

<p><em>Branching Questions</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did the journalist verify their source of the photo?</li>
  <li>If not, what parts of the tweet are false?</li>
  <li>Where did this photo come from? What's the place or scene it actually depicts?</li>   
</ul>  

<h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>  

<p>I'm not one to keep track of what is considered the best tool to use. My ideology is that if it gets the job done then good enough for me. However, I made a recent discovery of <a href="https://metaosint.github.io/chart">MetaOSINT</a> which provides a huge database of over 4000 OSINT resources.</p>   

<p>Like...wow?</p>  

<p>This will be so helpful for me since I am still unfamiliar with a lot of categories of tools that are out there. Yet as I go along, I'll document which tool I use.</p>  

<h2>The End Goal</h2>   

<p>Normally, there would be a section to assess the technical capabilities of the target, but in this case, there is no need.</p>  

<p>And like mentioned above, the end goal will be to verify the statement of the tweet.</p>  


<h1>Collection</h1>

<p>Some key things to remember:</p>  
<ul>
  <li>Initial and branching questions and the objective will the searching and collection</li>
  <li>Begin searching with broad strokes and then funnel down</li> 
  <li>Since this is a challenge that is fixed, there won't be an on-going investigation that will have multiple collection phases</li>
  <li>Documenting thought and discovery process helps with answering how connections between pieces of information are made</li>   
</ul>

<h2>Step By Step Thought Process</h2>  

<p>24th January, 2024</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thinking a classic reverse image search to start</li>    
  <li>TinEye reveals several instances (363 to be exact) where the same photo was used in various published sources with varying titles</li>  
  <li>I click on the <a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-060827-n-6477m-395-waziriya-iraq-aug-27-2006-a-vehicle-born-improvised-130204687.html?utm_source=77643&utm_campaign=Shop%20Royalty%20Free%20at%20Alamy&utm_medium=impact&irgwc=1">photo link</a> of first result that is from the site www.alamy.com and find a caption describing the photo as "a street outside of the Al Sabah newspaper office in the Waziryia district of Baghdad, Iraq"</li>  
  <li>Also, just a quick search of the site Alamy, my eyebrows raise to my hairline when I discover it is a stock image site, which is made more evident with the watermarks going across the photo</li>
  <li>Further reading of the 'Image Details' informs me that this image is a public domain image and that the date taken was on <strong>26th August, 2006</strong></li> 
  <ul>
    <li>Wanting to verify what the date of the incident that the tweet refers to, I do a quick Google Search of: ttp carried out a suicide attack on a police post in khyber city</li>   
    <li>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistani-taliban-attacks-police-outpost-killing-three-officers-2023-01-19/">Reuters article</a>, published on 19 Jan 2023 (same date as the Tweet), has similar information that lines up with what the Tweet talks about, this connects these two sources together</li>     
    <li>Also the Reuters article also confirms that TTP in the tweet is referring to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (and not tactics, techniques, and procedures as I immediately thought without thinking)</li>  
    <li>So the text content of the tweet <em>seems</em> true but based on the image details gathered from the stock image site Alamy, the photo used in the tweet is from 2006 whereas the incident described is from 2023 according to the date of the tweet </li>  
    <li>I realize I can narrow down my Google search by date using 'Tools' and filter only for searches that appear on 19th January, 2023</li>
    <li>Besides the Reuters article, I only find two other articles that talk about this incident</li>
    <li>I expand the date filter to 19th January, 2023 - 22nd January, 2023 but there are barely any sources talking about this specific incident</li>
  </ul>    
  <li>Circling back to my initial tangent of finding out what and where of the photo, I go back to the results in TinEye, thinking to click on other image links to see if they can provide a cross-reference for the Baghdad, Iraq location, and I see that a few different sites also refer the photo with 'Baghdad' or 'Iraq', further confirming suspicions this is the actual place of the photo and not Khyber city of Pakistan as the Tweet claims</li>
  <li>However, I do not think that counts as confirmation of the location</li> 
  <li>On the second page of TinEye, I find a <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorisme">Wikipedia page for terrorism but it's in Norwegian</a> since the site has the subdomain for Norway https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorisme</li>
  <li>But I don't see the photo, so I go to the Wayback Machine to try and find an old version of the site that may have the photo</li>
  <li>Thanks to TinEye I know the exact date the photo was first found and I navigate to December, 2010 but there are no snapshots for that year</li>
  <li>No problem, I'll check for the latest snapshot in 2011, which is on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501115511/https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorisme">1st of May</a></
