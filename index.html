    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>From most recent to oldest, here are prominent projects I've done. The projects with * indicate they are a work-in-progress project.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As a way to volunteer my services to my local library, I gathered, organized, and analyzed Los Angeles County Library System to perform Resource Allocation Analysis. Check out the <a href = "https://tori-ann.notion.site/Library-Resource-Allocation-Optimization-Work-In-Progress-a81ed799155c46fca469dac2d94a21fe" target ="_blank">project requirements</a>. *</li>
      <li>I built a typewriter simulator which is a text editor where you can't use the backspace. Try it out here: <a href="https://joycurator.github.io/TypewriterSimulator/" target="_blank">Typewriter app</a>
	  <li>Through a guided project written by Marynia Kolak, Moksha Menghaney, Qinyun Lin, and Angela Li, I learned how to perform geospatial analysis techniques such as: geocoding, buffer analysis, and nearest resource analysis. <a href = "https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/MethadoneClinicsGeospatialAnalysis" target ="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.</li>
	  <li>In part of completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, I created a capstone project to analyze Greenhouse Gas Emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Find the full report here: <a href="https://rpubs.com/joycuratoR/RadiantEnergy" target="_blank">RPubs</a></li>
      <li>I analyzed AM Wedding Film Co. Facebook Ads data to identify and track Key Performance Identifiers and then based on the data insights, recommended actionable solutions that reduced marketing expenses by 5%.</li>
      <li>The game Elden Ring exploded in popularity in 2022 and many Reddit users had negative and positive thoughts about its game mechanics. So using Reddit's API, I parsed and cleaned qualitative data to conduct sentiment analysis to discover the impact of Elden Ring's boss mechanics. Find the tutorial here: <a href="https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/Elden-Ring-Sentiment-Analysis-Guide" target="_blank">Elden Ring Sentiment Analysis Tutorial</a></li>
      <li>I created an automated Twitter account that requests Twitter's API to tweet daily inspirational quotes. Find the account here: <a href="https://twitter.com/SunshinecatLeo" target="_blank">@SunshinecatLeo</a> and build your own automated account with my <a href="https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/brainyquotebot" target="_blank">tutorial</a></li>
