			<h3>A few years ago, my sister confided her worries about enrolling her child in daycare, anxious over stranger danger scenarios where she 
			couldn't be present to protect her son. As we discussed vigilance around those who might harm innocents, I began reflecting more on the many ways 
			children can be exploited - not just by strangers, but through online tools allowing malicious actors access behind closed doors.</h3> 
			<p>This conversation lit a spark within me. I realized I couldnâ€™t stand idly by while the most vulnerable in our community face heightened risks
			of victimization, especially as dangers mutate and invade spaces once considered safe havens. I felt called to act with compassion and conviction.</h3>
			<h3>Since then, my mission has been to prevent, protect and educate children about exploitation in all its forms - offline and online. 
			By providing parents and kids with awareness and resources, I hope to disable threats before they ever manifest.</h3>
