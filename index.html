    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>From most recent to oldest for each section, here are prominent projects I've done. The projects with * indicate they are a work-in-progress project.</p>
    
	<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Working as an intern at Cyber Proud, gaining hands-on experience on troubleshooting hardware and software, configuring networks, operating systems and custom PC builds. *</li>
		<li>Learning basic Linux commands, network exploitation, web hacking, cryptography, Windows exploitation, shells and privilege escalations and gaining hands-on experience using <a href= "https://tryhackme.com/p/joycuratoR" target="_blank">TryHackMe</a>, HackTheBox, CompTIA and Google. *</li>

	</ul>
	
	<h3>Data Analytics</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>As a way to showcase my skills to gain a volunteering opportunity, I gathered, organized, and analyzed Los Angeles County Library System to perform Resource Allocation Analysis. Check out the <a href = "https://tori-ann.notion.site/Library-Resource-Allocation-Optimization-Work-In-Progress-a81ed799155c46fca469dac2d94a21fe" target ="_blank">project requirements</a> and <a href = "https://www.canva.com/design/DAFalkfzPew/m372AhfcxraY3hav4SrANg/view?utm_content=DAFalkfzPew&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink" target ="_blank">presentation of the results and recommendations</a>. </li>
		<li>Through a guided project written by Marynia Kolak, Moksha Menghaney, Qinyun Lin, and Angela Li, I learned how to perform geospatial analysis techniques such as: geocoding, buffer analysis, and nearest resource analysis. <a href = "https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/MethadoneClinicsGeospatialAnalysis" target ="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.</li>
	  <li>In part of completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, I created a capstone project to analyze Greenhouse Gas Emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Find the full report here: <a href="https://rpubs.com/joycuratoR/RadiantEnergy" target="_blank">RPubs</a></li>
      <li>I analyzed AM Wedding Film Co. Facebook Ads data to identify and track Key Performance Identifiers and then based on the data insights, recommended actionable solutions that reduced marketing expenses by 5%.</li>
      <li>The game Elden Ring exploded in popularity in 2022 and many Reddit users had negative and positive thoughts about its game mechanics. So using Reddit's API, I parsed and cleaned qualitative data to conduct sentiment analysis to discover the impact of Elden Ring's boss mechanics.
